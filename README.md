# Filler

The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other,
the game piece obtained by the game master (in the form of an executable Ruby program).
The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore.

The aim of the project is the introduction to basic algorithms and to manipulate input/outputs, by creating a player to fight on the Filler Board.
